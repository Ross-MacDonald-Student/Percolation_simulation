This is a code dump for the percolation simulation code used for my masters thesis

Masters Project: Salty Transistors
Student: Ross Glyn MacDonald
Supervisor: Dr Toby Hallam

Exclusion_zone_test1.m is the main file used to generate the results used in the diss all other files are functions

Nanosheets are generated by:
Generate_points.m or one of its derivatives
Connections are then detected by:
get_connections_3D.m
Clusters are then detected by:
clustering3D.m
Percolations is then detected by:
detect_percolation.m
If the system is percolated then the current through it is found by:
get_current.m
